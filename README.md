# Template for an open-source multi-platform Kotlin library

## How to use
* Clone (either Git commit history or file and directory structure)
* Make sure to change project group and name (Ã  la commit fc4ae70d1486bb02ae282bafe5be9c32d94d3b99; one option is to add
  a similar commit with the actual information and squash 3d6198aa25a2c5eef010252f2ed805c3a6382e9f,
  fc4ae70d1486bb02ae282bafe5be9c32d94d3b99 and the new commit all together into a single commit).
* Make sure to rewrite this (README.md) file (ideally replacing the commit which added it with another one).

## Notes
* Current Kotlin version is 1.7.10. Make sure to change (and ideally update this template) if using a more advanced
  version.
* JavaScript dependencies were pinned to whatever the tooling set by default on 2022-08-02; make sure to revisit if this
  does not match any specific use case.
