# Template for an open-source multi-platform Kotlin library

## How to use
* Clone (either Git commit history or file and directory structure)
* Make sure to change project name (Ã  la commit 82b3aed6c97e5f6f4da866d614cf467c6e0b6e65; one option is to replace that
  commit with another one).
* Make sure to rewrite this file (README.md).

## Notes
* Current Kotlin version is 1.7.0. Make sure to change (and ideally update this template) if using a more advanced
  version.
* JavaScript dependencies were pinned to whatever the tooling set by default on 2022-06-30; make sure to revisit if this
  does not match any specific use case.
